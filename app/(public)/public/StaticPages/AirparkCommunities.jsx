                    We have stayed in airpark communities far and wide. When
                    creating this list we considered several criteria.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    First, an airpark community is first and foremost just
                    that–a community. We needed to see a sense of fellowship,
                    camaraderie, and an overall family feeling for an airpark to
                    make our list. Second, we needed to see beauty. We wanted to
                    see the natural beauty of the area as well as the beauty of
                    the homes and common grounds.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Third, we looked for convenience. How close is the airpark
                    to shopping, dining, fuel, hospitals, recreation,
                    entertainment, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Fourth, overall grooviness. Some airparks offer a rich
                    history, some offer state-of-the-art amenities, and whatever
                    they offer, they just need to have that little je ne sais
                    quoi.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

                    ones we have found. We will keep adding to this list, so

                      Located just a few miles south of Daytona Beach, this is
                      one of the world's largest and most famous fly-in
                      communities. Spruce Creek is made up of approximately
                      5,000 residents living in 1,300 homes, most of these with
                      hangars to house their aircraft.

                      What really sets Spruce Creek apart is the sense of
                      community and family. With social clubs such as bridge,
                      gardening, motorcycling, flying, reading, EAA chapter,
                      among others, there seems to be something for everyone!
                      Many parties happen throughout the year including, in
                      chronological order: Wing-n-Wheels (aircraft, collector
                      cars and motorcycles are on display), Easter egg hunts,
                      what they call their "Summer Olympics Bash", a
                      back-to-school party, a huge fall carnival and feast, and
                      Christmas with Santa. Christmas celebrations are serious
                      fun as Santa Claus arrives in an airplane with Rudolph in
                      the back seat! They also have an annual Christmas parade
                      known as "Toy Parade" with cars, airplanes, golf carts,
                      and more all decked out for the holidays! There are also
                      many movie nights, a bonfire and other ongoing activities.
                      Owners of multi-million-dollar estates join
                      two-bedroom-condo owners to celebrate life in pure
                      friendship. This is exactly what we mean by community and
                      the very reason Spruce Creek made it to number one on our
                      list!

                      This is Georgia–what can we say? Georgia knows the meaning
                      of southern hospitality! Neighbors are friendly and truly
                      enjoy each others' company. With so much to do, you will
                      consistently see a group of neighbors heading out to do
                      something together. Kids roam free and so do lovable pets!
                      It really is a family feeling!

                      The homes in Heaven's Landing are spectacular. A very
                      strict architectural control committee makes sure this is
                      the case. Many of the lots by the runway have hangars or
                      hangar homes on them so they can taxi right into and out
                      of their property. Many other homes in the airpark are not
                      by the runway in order to take advantage of the stunning
                      mountain views. For these homes, there is a sensationally
                      designed hangar facility, complete with, "Wilson bi-fold
                      aluminum doors, standing seamed roofing, a full bathroom,
                      heat, and windows that aesthetically cause these hangars
                      to look nothing like hangars at all!"

                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                      The impressive clubhouse is another beautiful onsite
                      structure. It is the social focal point for the community.
                      It is open daily to all members of the community and can
                      also be booked for private events. With seating of upwards
                      of 200 people, the private lounge and dining room with
                      outside veranda offer ample room for even a wedding to
                      take place.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                      The clubhouse also features a fitness center with
                      racquetball, wally ball, billiards and recreational areas.
                      The dressing rooms feature steam rooms and sauna. Plans
                      are in place for a large swimming pool and Jacuzzi that
                      will afford views of the runway and gorgeous mountains.
