                  Hangar homes, ahhh the convenience! How we all love our hangar
                  homes! For those of you new to aviation, hangar homes are are
                  found in airpark communities, or fly-in communities. These
                  residences combine living quarters with aircraft hangar space
                  and provide access to a runway (or a waterway, in the case of
                  seaplanes). Here are some great ideas we have seen in hangar
                  homes around the world–ideas that contribute to creative
                  design, luxury, and innovation.

                  Not only does climate control make working on aircraft very
                  comfortable, this feature is vital for those who own vintage
                  or delicate aircraft that require specific storage conditions.

                    High-Clearance Doors:
                  </span>{" "}
                  Almost gone are the days of manually operated doors. Owners
                  now opt for specially-designed doors that accommodate aircraft
                  of varying sizes. Hydraulic and bifold doors are, of course,
                  the most popular, but mechanical bottom-rolling doors, both
                  bi-parting and unidirectional, are gaining popularity due to
                  their sleek look and their ability to withstand extremely
                  strong wind and weather conditions.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Stack doors are also becoming more popular, especially in
                  areas where consistent power is an issue. Stack doors can be
                  operated manually with ease and are not power-dependent. Also,
                  unlike vertical lift doors that consume up to 2 feet of
                  overhead space, the height of the framed opening for a stack
                  door is the same as the height of the clear opening,
                  eliminating that 2-foot waste.

                  <span className="font-bold text-[#AF2322]">Lighting:</span>{" "}
                  Proper lighting has two criteria–reducing energy consumption
                  while increasing visibility. Having good visibility is crucial
                  in order to find issues, eliminate mistakes, and increase
                  safety. An average-sized private hangar should have no less
                  than 500-750LUX illumination while larger hangars'
                  requirements can go up to 2,000LUX! LED lighting is the
                  lighting of choice not only for its cost effectiveness, but
                  much more importantly, for the way the light travels from the
                  high ceilings of a hangar to the floor. Other types of
                  lighting can make it difficult to tell colors apart, crucial
                  when working with the color-coded parts of an aircraft such as
                  wires! Needless to say, only the best lighting will do.

                    Epoxy Flooring:

                  Epoxy flooring is the most desirable type of flooring for a
                  hangar due to its functionality and aesthetics. A high-quality
                  epoxy will make cleaning easy and will protect the floor from
                  wear for decades. Most epoxy comes with a lifetime warranty
                  for a reason–it lasts and lasts.
