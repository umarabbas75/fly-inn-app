Our favorite lakes are Redfish Lake which boasts the most incredible backdrop–the Sawtooth Mountains’ jagged peaks; Pettit Lake, because it is beautiful and very close to us; and Alturas Lake which, true to its Spanish name meaning heights, sits an entire 20 feet higher than Pettit!

Stroll upstairs and enter through a salon style swing door into the apartment at large. This open concept apartment flows around the 180 degree backdrop vista of Grand Mesa to Land’s End. Beautiful tile, quartz countertops, modern appliances and cozy accommodations abound. The open flow has a separate private bedroom with a King bed or 2 XL twins and laundry niche. The living room offers an additional queen sized futon. The kitchen is adequately stocked to accommodate a comfortable stay. An L-shaped breakfast bar adjoins the kitchen and living space.

Enter into the downstairs sitting-room vestibule that captures a glimpse of the indoor hangar. This area offers storage and a cozy workspace. Stroll upstairs and enter through a salon style swing door into the apartment at large. This open concept apartment flows around the 180 degree backdrop vista of Grand Mesa to Land’s End. Beautiful tile, quartz countertops, modern appliances and cozy accommodations abound. The open flow has a separate private bedroom with a King bed or 2 XL twins and laundry niche. The living room offers an additional queen sized futon. The kitchen is adequately stocked to accommodate a comfortable stay. An L-shaped breakfast bar adjoins the kitchen and living space.
